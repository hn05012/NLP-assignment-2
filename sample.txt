Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. ML has gained significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications in fields like healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.

One of the key areas of machine learning is supervised learning, where algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions. In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with finding patterns in data without labeled examples.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand and process human language. NLP is used in applications like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

Document retrieval is one of the core tasks in NLP. It involves searching for relevant documents from a large collection based on a user's query. To perform effective document retrieval, systems rely on techniques like vector space models, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and embeddings.

Document chunking is an important technique in document retrieval. Large documents are often split into smaller chunks for easier processing. These chunks can then be indexed and retrieved individually, improving both search efficiency and the quality of results.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library that is widely used for efficient similarity search. It allows for fast search of large datasets, making it an ideal tool for document retrieval tasks. By using FAISS, we can index document chunks and perform efficient nearest-neighbor search for queries.

In conclusion, machine learning, NLP, and document retrieval are closely related fields that provide valuable tools for creating intelligent systems capable of understanding and processing human language.
